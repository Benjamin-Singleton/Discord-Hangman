Hangman Project

use `npm i` and run `node deploy-commands.js`, then `node index.js`

create `config.json` file within the main folder, and add your bot's `token`, `clientId` and the `guildId` of the server you want the bot to run on to it.

within discord, type `/hangman` to initiate a game of hangman!
